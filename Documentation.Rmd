### Thanks for checking out the Expected Return Calculator

With this app, you can determine the expected return you would obtain from investing up to $10 000 in the stocks of 15 of the most highly traded companies on the stock market at current market price, using the minimum variance portfolio. 

You can toggle views between the risk-return portfolio cloud and the efficient frontier plot with the radio button on the left.

Every portfolio analysis function used in this app belongs to the ```stockPortfolio``` package by David Diez and Nicolas Christou.
